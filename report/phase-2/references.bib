  abstract = {The gem5 simulation infrastructure is the merger of the best aspects of the M5 [4] and GEMS [9] simulators. M5 provides a highly configurable simulation framework, multiple ISAs, and diverse CPU models. GEMS complements these features with a detailed and exible memory system, including support for multiple cache coherence protocols and interconnect models. Currently, gem5 supports most commercial ISAs (ARM, ALPHA, MIPS, Power, SPARC, and x86), including booting Linux on three of them (ARM, ALPHA, and x86).The project is the result of the combined efforts of many academic and industrial institutions, including AMD, ARM, HP, MIPS, Princeton, MIT, and the Universities of Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. Over the past ten years, M5 and GEMS have been used in hundreds of publications and have been downloaded tens of thousands of times. The high level of collaboration on the gem5 project, combined with the previous success of the component parts and a liberal BSD-like license, make gem5 a valuable full-system simulation tool.},

  abstract = {The recent changes made in the Linux kernel aim at achieving better energy efficiency through a tighter integration between the CPU scheduler and the frequency-scaling subsystem. However, in the current implementation, the frequency scaling mechanism is used only when there are no real-time tasks in execution. This paper shows how the deadline scheduler and the cpufreq subsystem can be extended to relax this constraint and implement an energy-aware real-time scheduling algorithm. In particular, we describe the design issues encountered when implementing the GRUB-PA algorithm on a real operating system like Linux. A set of experimental results on a multi-core ARM platform validate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation.},
